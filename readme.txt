WooCommerce Send CSVs to your Fullfillment-Partner

Automatically sending of daily E-Mails with CSV data to your Fullfilment Partner.

== Description ==
You can export the most important fields assigned to the orders and then you can send this data as CSV to any e-mail address. The only thing you have to do is to set up a cronjob at your provider and using the created link of the plugin. Every time you run the cronjob, the plugin looks for the latest completed orders since the last cronjob and creates a new CSV. This CSV will be sent to the entered e-mail. You can also download the CSV files at the history list.
